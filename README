Automated Login Stress Test
Functional Stability Validation – Automation Exercise
This project was developed to validate the functional stability and session consistency of a web authentication flow under repeated execution. Using Python with Playwright, the test automates multiple consecutive login and logout cycles on the public test application https://automationexercise.com/.
The objective was not limited to validating a successful login. The main purpose was to observe how the application behaves when subjected to repeated state transitions, simulating continuous user authentication activity and evaluating behavioral consistency over time.
The automated flow performs the following steps in sequence: access the homepage, navigate to the login page, submit valid credentials, validate successful authentication by checking the logged-in state, execute logout, and repeat the process in consecutive cycles. Each cycle validates the application state to ensure that authentication and session termination behave as expected.
The project follows a structured automation architecture using the Page Object Model (POM), with clear separation of responsibilities across files. The data layer centralizes configuration and credentials, the page layer encapsulates locators and interaction methods, and the main execution file controls the test flow. Explicit waiting strategies are applied to ensure synchronization and stability during execution.
The technology stack includes Python 3.x, Playwright (Sync API), and PyCharm as the development environment. The structure was intentionally designed to be scalable and maintainable, allowing future extension to testing frameworks such as PyTest, as well as integration with reporting tools, CI pipelines, and headless execution.
During extended repetition cycles, behavioral inconsistencies were observed after prolonged execution. This reinforces an important engineering principle: systems that function correctly under isolated execution may expose instability when subjected to repeated state transitions. Such findings highlight the importance of iterative execution, state validation, and resilience-focused functional testing.
This project demonstrates structured automation design, clean separation of concerns, appropriate synchronization techniques, and a stability-oriented testing mindset. It reflects not only the ability to automate user flows, but also the analytical approach required to evaluate system behavior beyond single execution scenarios.
Potential future improvements include integration with PyTest, automated HTML reporting, screenshot capture on failure, retry mechanisms for transient issues, headless execution for CI environments, and performance measurement per authentication cycle.
Authentication flows are critical components of web applications. Testing them through repeated execution provides deeper insight into session management, state handling, and overall application robustness. This project represents a practical application of automation engineering principles focused on validating functional resilience.
